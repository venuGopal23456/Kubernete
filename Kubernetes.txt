Creating Single Cluster in Kubernetes
1)Minikube start(Interact Kubernetes using kubectl (CLI)
   Auto:Kubernetes Cluster start
	Minikube starts VM 
	Moving files to Cluster
	Connecting to Cluster
	Starting Cluster
	Kubectl Config
	Load images in config
2)Kubectl
	CLI for Kubernetes 
	Display client and Server for version
	Client-Kubectl;Server-Kubernetes
        PTR:Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.
        PTR:The cluster can be interacted with using the kubectl CLI. This is the main approach used for managing Kubernetes and the applications running on top of the cluster.
3)Nodes are created.














Deploy a application
1)Provide all the information about the application path for deployment by kubectl
2)Operation done by Kubectl
	=>Searched for suitable Node
	=>Schedule the appication to run on the node
	=>configured the cluster to reschedule on a new node
        =>kubectl get deployments-to know running container
3)To Interact with the other pods,we use proxy on another terminal
4)Need Pods name to Interact via the proxy
5)The url is the route to the API of the Pod.




Explore pods
1)Describe Pods give info about IP address,Ports and List of Events Related to the Lifecycle of Pods.
2)Get info about Logs of the Container inside the pod.




Exposing the app(Outside the Cluster)
1)Create New Service  using Expose command
2)To find what port was opened Externally,we Create Environment Variable.
3)use label to query list of pods.
4)Confirm the Service is not Reachable from outside.




Scale Your app
1)Increase the Replicas,which shows more Pods after Increasing.
2)Load Balancing-we hit Different pod with every Request.
3)Scale Down-Reduce the Replica.




Update the app
1)Change the Version of the app.
2)Describe the pods to see the updated version.
